# PyBank

For the PyBank portion of the project, I had to get some help when calculating 
the average change. I did not know how to code it into my for loop to get the difference between each row. 

When I reached out to AskBCS, the Learning Assistant gave me the idea of getting the value of the first row, and setting it to a variable, then using that variable to get calculate the previous value which would then be used in my for loop. These variables are represented as "first_row" and "prev_net."

# PyPoll

For the PyPoll portion of the project, I was getting the correct answers, but I was unsure how to get the answers that were supposed to be in a percentage, as a percentage, and I was unsure how to round them to 3 decimal places as it is represented in the answer on Bootcamp Spot.

When researching how to do this, this led me to the "format" function found in a youtube video. The link to this video is provided below:
